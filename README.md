# Machine-Learning-Course-Project-3
Prediction of Most Space Occupied Digit from Modified MNIST Database Using Supervised Classification Models. Convolutional neural network (CNN) and support vector machine (SVM) are used as the supervised models for training. Further modification achieved by applying data augmentation and transfer learning approaches. With Cross-validation,the best model
was selected to be submitted to the kaggle competition.
